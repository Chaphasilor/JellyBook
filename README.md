  Hi, this is a passion project I am working on.
  Its an app that's meant to allow you to read your files from Jellyfin on mobile.
  It is in a state where I do believe it's usable for most comic reading and some books, but it still has a long way to go.

## :construction: Todo:
 - [X] Vertical scrolling
 - [X] Audiobooks
 - [ ] A more consistent experience between the rest of the formats and PDFs (PDFs work a bit differently)
 - [X] Allow local caching of current files while viewing collection when offline (proper offline support)
 - [X] Remember user support
 - [ ] Multiple server support
 - [X] Settings page
 - [ ] For the download completed screen I want to add a image or GIF of a jellyfish reading a book (credit to thornbill on the Matrix server for that idea)
 - [ ] UI overhaul in several areas of the app (will keep current as options for those who want it)
        - [ ] Part of the current issue is that it looks like an Android app made in Flutter; although it is made in Flutter, I want it to have a more cross-platform feel to it
 - [ ] Background download
 - [ ] Publish to several stores

## :warning: Known Issues
 - Due to the re-working of several components, you may need to reset the app's data after upgrading so that it still functions as intended
